## Lab 2 [Making Ethernet cable using twisted pair cables (crisscross way)]

### Objective

- Create a ethernet cable using twisted pair cables in crisscross way

### Tools needed

- Unshielded Twisted pair cable (UTP)
- Modular connector (RJ45)
- Crimping tool

### Theory

- Ethernet cable is a widely used cabling techinque in LAN networks that uses the Unshielded twisted pair cable as data transmitting wire and `RJ45` as an modular connector.
- It is relatively use to build within few steps and with correct tools anyone can create it.
- It is cheap to build, easy to build and highly reliable.
- In this lab we used the different color pin method rather than standard way to decide which colored wire goes in which pin in RJ45.

### Steps

1. Take a long set of twisted pair cable wire.
2. Use `LAN wire cutter` to cut the outer shell of the wire.
3. Use `Crimping tool` to straightened the twisted wires.
4. Insert the wires in the following format in `RJ45 connector`

- For Side 1

Pin | Wire color
--|--
Pin 1 | Brown
Pin 2 | White/Brown
Pin 3 | Green
Pin 4 | White/Green
Pin 5 | White/Orange
Pin 6 | Blue
Pin 7 | White/Blue
Pin 8 | Orange

- For Side 2

Pin | Wire color
--|--
Pin 1 | White/Green
Pin 2 | Green
Pin 3 | White/Orange
Pin 4 | Blue
Pin 5 | White/Blue
Pin 6 | Orange
Pin 7 | White/Brown
Pin 8 | Brown

5. Use `Crimping tool` to press RJ45 in place 
6. Repeat step 2 , 3, 4 and 5 for the other side
7. Use `Cable tester` to check if all the wires are connected successfully and free of error.
